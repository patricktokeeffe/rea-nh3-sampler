Maintenance requirements
========================

Recirculation pump
------------------

- At light loads (+15psi full vacuum) and constant operation the diaphragms 
    should be inspected annually.



Data output
===========

- Even though 'flux' data output frequency can be adjusted from default 30min,
    it really shouldn't be.

Time series data table
----------------------

- Values in the time-series table have been 'lagged' so as to align the time
    of measurement despite differing instrument 'lags'
