The document `Denuder_assay_workbook.xlsx` is an Excel&trade; spreadsheet 
for recording and analyzing data from the denuder extraction procedure. 
It contains three worksheets:

* **Standard Curve** for developing a linear regression of concentration as a
  function of absorbance
* **Denuder Assay** for evaluating total mass captured on each denuder, 
  accounting for controls (blanks) and sample dilution(s)
* **REA Flux** for calculating gas fluxes based on micrometeorological 
  parameters recorded by the datalogger and results of the denuder assay
